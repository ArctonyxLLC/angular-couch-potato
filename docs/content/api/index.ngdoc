## Couch Potato API Reference

You can use the navbar on the left to search (see footnote), or
click an item from the table of contents.

If you're looking for an overview of Couch Potato or want to know how to
get started, try the [guide](#/guide).

*Footnote: Well, you __should__ be able to use the search, but it's broken in this version of Angular docs -- you can't (usefully) click on the results it finds :(*
